## üåü Growth Psychology

This app is built on proven psychological principles:

### 1. **Compound Effect**
Small, consistent actions create exponential results over time.

### 2. **Single Focus**
Tracking one habit prevents overwhelm and increases success rates.

### 3. **Visual Progress**
Seeing growth curves motivates continued action.

### 4. **Milestone Celebrations**
Regular achievements maintain motivation during the journey.

### 5. **Social Sharing**
Sharing progress creates accountability and inspires others.

## üîß Customization

### Modify Growth Formula
Edit the `calculateGrowth` function in `script.js`:
```javascript

    const effectiveDays = days * consistency;
    return (Math.pow(dailyImprovement, effectiveDays) - 1) * 100;
}
```

### Change Milestones
Update the milestones object in `script.js`:
```javascript
milestones: {
    7: { achieved: false, date: null },    // Week
    30: { achieved: false, date: null },   // Month
    90: { achieved: false, date: null },   // Quarter
    365: { achieved: false, date: null }   // Year
